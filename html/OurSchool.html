            <h3> <a href="https://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/schools/woottonhs/programs/stars.aspx"> STARS (Science, Technology, and Research Scholars) </a> </h2>
                <p> STARS is a rigorous, 4-year program for highly motivated students. It is designed for those with a deep interest in exploring science and research, and who wish to prepare for future careers in a STEM or STEM-related field. The STARS program is a highly enriched and provides ample opportunities and support for students to explore their passion for STEM in a diverse community of learners. Central to the program is the Capstone: a required, 2-year program comprised of AP Seminar in junior year and AP Research in senior year. At the completion of the two year Capstone program, students will have learned research methods and conducted their own independent research. In addition, all students will complete an off-campus experience, which could be in a science internship in support of their research project. Rising 9th graders apply in the spring of their 8th grade year.</p>
