    <p>Allison Waters, famously known as ALLY, is a pop/country singer residing in the DC area. Growing up in Tennesse, 
        Ally saw her parents and relatives always singing at open mic nights and at rodeos, "I never remember a time where we weren't singing a Dolly Parton medley or 
        dancing around our kitchen table at Saturday breakfasts. It's all I've ever known", the 18 year old rising star told E News. She hopes to eventually become someone that 
        people look up to and follow: "I want people to know me as someone who followed her  passion and made it big by sticking to it.
        If I can do it, they can surely do it too".Ally's jouney has been tough, however, she has persevered and has slowly inched her
    way up the entertainment industry, recieving endorsements and collaborating opportunites from artists such as Ariana Grande and 
Bruno Mars. She is excited to see what is in store for her next and will be hosting a handful of private concerts in the DC area.</p>
