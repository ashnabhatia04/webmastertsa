        Allison Waters, famously known as ALLY, is a pop/country singer residing in the DC area. Growing up in Tennesse,
        Ally saw her parents and relatives always singing at open mic nights and at rodeos, "I never remember a time where we weren't singing a Dolly Parton medley or
        dancing around our kitchen table at Saturday breakfasts. It's all I've ever known", the 18 year old rising star told E News. She hopes to eventually become someone that
        people look up to and follow: "I want people to know me as someone who followed her passion and made it big by sticking to it.
        If I can do it, they can surely do it too".
